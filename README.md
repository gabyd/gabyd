- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabyd
- 👀 I’m interested in labour markets, casuality and education.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and relearning a whole bunch of R things that i'd forgotten
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on business data (think asx info, etc)
- 📫 How to reach me - i'll likely be the last hold out on twitter so you can find me there @gabster0191
